 -----INSTRUCTIONS-----
 You will receive a JSON description of a Salesforce CRM Account record.
 When I ask you generate a summary of the record, you must strictly follow my Content Guidelines, Formatting Guidelines and HTML Generation Guidelines below:
 Content Guidelines: &quot;&quot;&quot;
 * Your goal is to summarize the record, using the 3rd person point of view.
 * You must avoid complex language, industry jargon, or technical terms.
 * When generating the summary, you must not follow the sequence of the data given to you; instead, generate the summary in a cohesive narrative that enhances clarity with a beginning, middle, and ending.
 * When referring to the summarized record, you must not include articles, such as &quot;the&quot;, or any other determiners. For example, you must not say &quot;the Account&quot; nor &quot;the record is an Account&quot;, instead, you must say &quot;Account is...&quot;.
 
 * The following sections should be included in the summary in the following order:
 1. Account Overview
 * Start with the Account name bold and linked
 * Summarize Account High level details including: Description, Employee Count, Industry, Sum of closed deal amounts, Sum amount in the open pipe, Owner.
 2. Opportunities
 * This MUST start with the number of lost and won opportunities. i.e: There are &lt;X&gt; won, &lt;Y&gt; lost over the last year.
 * You must include data of top Opportunities. Include the Status on the summary.
 * All Opportunities MUST be linked
 * Do not include Closed Won or Closed Lost Opportunities
 * Do not calculate the total amounts.
 3. Open cases
 * Include only the number of cases and how many are escalated. DO NOT include any other information.
 * Open cases are determined by the value in the Status flag or label under Case section. 4. Activity
 * Include recent activities and future tasks and events.
 5.Contacts
 * You MUST include detailed data about keyContacts
 * Include data from Contacts where Last Name is Gonzalez and linked to the account
 
 6. Recent Purchases
 * Include information about Leading Product Licenses,and Top Lost Products, without percentage and counts.
 
 * **Do not** summarize each related record in a separate paragraph.
 * Make the summary concise, each section should contain 2-3 sentences max.
 * Do not explicitly mention the Account Name in each section.
 * Summarize trends across the related records, intermixed with the summary of the main record.
 * You must not invent any information that is not part of the DATA provided.
 * If the detail such as Employee Count is not part of the DATA provided, **do not** generate any generic information, instead skip that detail and move on.
 
 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 Formatting Guidelines: &quot;&quot;&quot;
 1.  Display fields with &quot;hyperlink&quot; information as links. Example:
 &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Dorothy Gale&quot;,
 &quot;hyperlink&quot;: &quot;&lt;a href=&apos;/001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&apos;&gt;Dorothy Gale&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
 should be mentioned in the summary as: &lt;a href=&apos;/001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&apos;&gt;Dorothy Gale&lt;/a&gt;
 2. Each section name should be in bold and inline in the paragraph: &quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; Top opportunities show...&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
 3. When appropriate, add emphasis to certain pieces of text, up to 2 or 3 words at a time, by italicizing adjective + noun or verb + object combinations.
 
 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 HTML Generation Guidelines: &quot;&quot;&quot;
 When generating the HTML, you must use semantic elements whenever possible:
 1. &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs
 2. &lt;a&gt; for links
 3. &lt;strong&gt; for bolded content
 4. &lt;em&gt; for italicized content
 5. Don&apos;t use any heading tags.
 
 &quot;&quot;&quot;
